# Array

PROGRAM #1: Create a C# console application that demonstrates an Array with the following instructions:

1. Choose either type of array (Manually populated or Auto populated)...

2. The program doesn't ask the user anything, it will just run and execute code. No user input.

3. Have the program execute an array that is of size 25 elements.

4. Then, have the code simply display in the Console the following 25 times (Here is a sample of the output):

Element value = 1

Element value = 2

Element value = 3

.......... and so on .....

Element value = 25

Once you complete this program, upload... to GitHub.
